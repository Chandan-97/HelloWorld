Hey there, Folk!
I'm editing this readme merely for the purpose of learning how branches work. Although, it says "Read Me", you literally shouldn't bother to read this!

That was just a suggesion, I know you are still reading it. Now-a-days nobody listens to good suggesions:P

See I told you it's worthless wasting your time reading this, but yeah, we all have wasted our time doing random stupid stuff more often than not! So it's fine, after all even I wasted my time writing this :v

Hey, congratulations! You made it to the end and you yourself don't know why, but that's fine. Enjoy your rest of the day.

Goodbye :)
